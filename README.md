# Quiz-Taking-Web-App

This web app is a full-stack web app created using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. This web app provides the user with a friendly user experience to answer quiz questions and review his or her results. So far the web app only has 5 quiz questions for the user to answer. Next steps for this project is to possibly switch to a better database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB due to the SQLite database provided by Django not being able to hold array types in its models. This project is scalable for having more quiz questions and quizzes for the user to take.

This app is deployed on Heroku: https://quiz-taking-web-app.herokuapp.com/
